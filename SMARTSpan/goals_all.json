Being healthy is also important for supporting loved ones and spending quality time with friends.\r\n3-month goals: (1) Prevent the onset of osteoporosis. (2) Protect and preserve knee health. (3) Work towards gradual weight loss.\r\nEnergy level: Moderate. Client began the session by discussing ongoing feelings of hunger, which they believe are linked to their current medication routine. This hunger has led to weight gain and difficulty managing intake.\r\nMedication: Client repeatedly sought reassurance and shared concerns about current medication side effects, including persistent hunger that interferes with sleep, increased consumption of rice, noodles, and porridge, as well as headaches that limit daily functioning.\r\nGoal review 1 (Diet): Reported significant success in reducing intake of roti prata. Had it only once in the past month, attributing success to avoiding certain shops, skipping breakfast, or opting for alternatives like toast and eggs.\r\nGoal review 2 (Knee care): Client rated knee massage practice as 8/10. This is done once a week and is perceived as helpful. Typically performed when remembered.\r\nGoal review 3 (App usage): Client explored app content but found the information basic and already familiar. Searches for medical information independently online, recently focusing on medication side effects and drug interactions. Found the app\u2019s food diary less useful compared to others that offer detailed nutrition breakdowns or calorie tracking.\r\nGenerative moment: Discussed hunger management and the types of foods consumed\u2014such as porridge, noodles, and milk\u2014which may not be very filling. Explored more satiating alternatives, though client shared that such options are not easily available in nearby food courts, indicating limited readiness for dietary change.\r\nMedication discussion: Client expressed a strong desire to stop current medication due to side effects. Explored options including trial breaks, returning to a previous medication routine, and consulting a pharmacist or physician for guidance.\r\nFuture areas of interest: Weight management and sustainable dietary strategies.\r\nAction item: Follow up on medication-related symptoms and explore diet planning in more detail.",

Demonstrated strong awareness of food choices and reported a 60\u201370% success rate in maintaining a healthy diet. Shared that overeating often happens in social settings or during buffets. Diet appears to be an area of personal interest, prompting a deeper discussion about strategies for healthy eating during the fasting month. One ongoing goal is to cook at home more often to better control ingredients and include more fruits and vegetables.

Social support remains strong, with several friend groups providing regular emotional support. While social outings may reduce temporarily, client feels understood by the circle and continues to lean on them. Energy levels are a key priority right now, with caregiving responsibilities requiring sustained physical and emotional stamina. Medication adherence has improved with the help of app reminders. No concerning symptoms reported, though some neck tightness was noted. Client plans to take daily BP readings before bed and share the data with a doctor at the next appointment. Client is solution-oriented and attributes this mindset to previous fundraising experience.

App review: Shared that AI tools are useful for health-related queries, offering empathy, voice support, and simple explanations.
